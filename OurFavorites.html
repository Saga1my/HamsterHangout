            <h3>Reasoning: This hamster is an expert jailbreaker. He can escape from any prison and has previously escaped from a ultimate maximum security prison named Alcatraz. He is the first hamster in history to do so. </h3>

                <h3>Reasoning: This hamster has incredible gaming skills. She is nothing less than a feminist icon. We have never seen such skill before.</h3>

                <h3>Reasoning: This hamster makes his own tea and owns a small but fancy shop in London. At only two years old he has already made tea for the queen multiple times. She claimed it was the best tea she had ever had in her life. She died shortly after (the tea most likley had nothing to do with this).</h3>

                <h3>Reasoning: This hamster is really not that impressive. She chewed through this box really quickly to impress us but due to all the cardboard she ate she quickly became very ill so we felt bad.</h3>
